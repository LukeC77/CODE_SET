 *
 *     The `read.c` file implements the `readUM` function, which reads a UM 
 *     instruction file and stores the instructions in a table. 
 *     It handles file validation, reads data in 32-bit chunks, 
 *     and stores it in a sequence within segment 0, ensuring 
 *     proper error handling for file and input issues.

/********** readUM ********
 * read UM instruction sets and store into segment 0
 * which is implemented by Hanson's Sequence
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *      char* filenameï¼ša string represents file that we want to read
 *      Table_t table: store all segments 
 *     
 * Return: 
 *      None
 * Expects:
 *      - If we fail to open UM file, raise exception 
 *      - If table is NULL, raise exception
 *
 * Notes:
 *      - filename should be a um file. Extension should be .um .
 *      - read each four byte and store into sequence
