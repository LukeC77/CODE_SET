Architecture:
- imageIO: Handles the first and last stages of compression and decompression.
           Reads and writes original/decompressed images as the entry point of
           both processes, and then can read and write compressed images as the
           last steps.
- compvideo: Handles the conversion between RGB values and component video.
- chroma: Handles the conversion between chroma values as floats and encoded
          four-bit chroma averages.
- dct: Handles the conversion between pixel space and DCT space.
- codeword: Packs and unpacks 32-bit code words.
